    "\n",
    "The quick summary is that there are two parts of most scale functions.  The first part describes **what** we want to scale, and the second part describes **how** we want to scale it.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the whats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. alpha — Using alpha transparency levels to differentiate categories\n",
    "2. color — Using a color scale as a way to differentiate categories\n",
    "3. fill — Using a color fill as a way of describing a variable\n",
    "4. linetype — Using the line type (e.g., solid line, dotted line, dashed line) to differentiate categories\n",
    "5. shape — Using a shape (e.g., circle, triangle, square) to differentiate categories\n",
    "6. size — Using the size of a shape to differentiate categories\n",
    "7. x — Change the scale of the X axis\n",
    "8. y — Change the scale of the Y axis\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the hows, which I’ll break up into two categories.  The first category is the “differentiation” hows, which handle alpha, color, fill, linetype, shape, and size:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Continuous\n",
    "2. Discrete\n",
    "3. Brewer\n",
    "4. Distiller\n",

    "6. Grey\n",
    "7. Hue\n",
    "8. Identity\n",
    "9. Manual\n",

    "3. Log10\n",
    "4. Reverse\n",
    "5. Sqrt\n",
    "6. Date / Time / Datetime\n",

    "There are a few scale functions which don’t fit this pattern (scale_radius) and a couple which have “default” how values (scale_alpha, scale_size, scale_shape).  Also, not all whats intersect with hows:  for example, there is no scale_shape_continuous or scale_size_hue because those combinations don’t make sense.\n",

You can specify your own colors if you’d like, or you can ask [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) for help.  For example, suppose I want to segment by gapminder data by continent, displaying each continent as a different color.  I can use the scale_color_brewer function to generate an appropriate set of colors for me, and it adds just one more line of code.\n",

In this case, I’m going to show all three even though the data doesn’t really fit two of them.\n",

Our continent legend is based on the color of data points—we defined that up in `geom_point()`—so we want to modify the guide associated with color.  To modify this, we use the [guide_legend()](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guide_legend.html) function.  The `guide_legend()` function lets us set details on the legend, like how many rows or columns, what the legend title should be, label ordering, and positioning.\n",
